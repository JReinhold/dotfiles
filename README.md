# JReinhold dotfiles

Scripts to setup a fresh macOS installation with apps and settings.
Heavily inspired by [mathiasbynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

## Usage

**Warning**: If you want to give this setup a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

## Using git

The full script can be downloaded and executed using the command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jreinhold/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles & ./init.sh
```

Sit back and relax with a cup of ☕️

## Usage

It uses native notifications to notify the user when an new app has been installed, and is ready to be set up by the user.

A final list of each app installed (and failed) will be placed in `~/Desktop/appList.txt`. Use this as your personal To Do-list, to cross off each app when you have set it up with your preferences.

## ErgoDox EZ keyboard

I use the ErgoDox EZ keyboard with a custom layout. The firmware is located in this repository, and can be seen [here](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/gZwN/latest/0)
